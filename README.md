# python-homework

This repository contains the Week 2 homework assigments- PyBank and PyRamen.

Technologies used for both the tasks- Python.

Tools used- Jupyter lab.

The output was not achieved for both the assignements.
For PyBank, the logic is appropriate. However, there are some syntax errors and the fully working code was not reached. Requested for a tutor on BootCamp spot on Sep 22 1 AM and as of Sep 26, 2 AM, a tutor has not been assigned, even after multiple followups.

PyRamen was challenging and it took a deep level of thought to write the code. The code is mostly correct, however, it does not run on Jupyter lab.
